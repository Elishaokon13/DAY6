## Project Status Board
- [x] Initialize a new git repository in DAY6 as requested
- [ ] Recreate auto_commit.py script for the new DAY6 git repository
- [ ] Review and confirm before running the script, as it will generate a large number of commits and push to the remote repository

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- A new git repository has been initialized in DAY6. The next step is to recreate the auto_commit.py script for this new repository. Please confirm if you want to proceed with the same script logic (3000 commits, push to remote) or if you want any changes before proceeding.
- The script auto_commit.py has been created in DAY6. It will:
  - Make 3000 commits, each with a unique message, by appending to a marker file in DAY6.
  - Add and commit the marker file for each commit.
  - Push all commits to the remote repository at the end.
- Please review and confirm before running, as this will create a large number of commits and push them to your remote repository. If you want to test with fewer commits first, let me know and I can adjust the script.

# Contract Verification-as-a-Service Tool (Planner Mode)

## Background and Motivation
The goal is to build a sleek, user-friendly Contract Verification-as-a-Service web app. This tool will allow users to verify smart contracts on Etherscan-style explorers by pasting a contract address, source code, and configuration, then submitting for verification. The app should provide clear feedback, highlight issues, and use modern UI/UX best practices with Aceternity UI, Monaco/CodeMirror, and Next.js.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Integrating Monaco/CodeMirror editor for Solidity with syntax highlighting and error handling
- Fetching and displaying available Solidity compiler versions (with auto-detection)
- Proxying verification requests securely to Etherscan-style APIs from the backend
- Handling multiple chains and displaying results per explorer
- Providing real-time feedback, error/warning highlighting, and explorer links
- Ensuring a clean, responsive, and professional UI using Aceternity UI and Tailwind CSS
- Bonus: Using eth_getCode, solc-version-finder, and solc-js for advanced features

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. **Project Setup**
   - [ ] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
   - [ ] Install Aceternity UI, Monaco/CodeMirror, and required dependencies
   - Success: Project runs with a basic home page and all dependencies installed

2. **UI Layout & Components**
   - [ ] Design the main layout using Aceternity UI (responsive, clean)
   - [ ] Add input fields for contract address, optimization toggle, optimization runs
   - [ ] Integrate Monaco/CodeMirror editor for Solidity code
   - [ ] Add dropdown for compiler version selection
   - [ ] Add Verify button and loading spinner
   - Success: All UI elements are present, styled, and responsive

3. **Backend API Routes**
   - [ ] Create API route to proxy verification requests to Etherscan-style endpoints
   - [ ] Handle multiple chains (Etherscan, BaseScan, Arbiscan, etc.)
   - [ ] Return status, response, and explorer links
   - Success: API securely proxies requests and returns expected data

4. **Verification Flow**
   - [ ] Implement form submission and call backend API
   - [ ] Display verification status/results per chain in cards
   - [ ] Show clickable explorer links
   - [ ] Show toasts/alerts for errors/warnings (e.g., mismatches)
   - Success: User can verify a contract and see results/errors clearly

5. **Advanced Features (Bonus)**
   - [ ] Use eth_getCode to fetch deployed bytecode
   - [ ] Use solc-version-finder to auto-detect compiler version
   - [ ] Optionally compile with solc-js before submission
   - Success: Advanced features work and improve UX

6. **Testing & Polish**
   - [ ] Add tests for API and UI flows
   - [ ] Polish UI, loading states, and error handling
   - [ ] Final review for responsiveness and UX
   - Success: All core and bonus features work, UI is sleek and robust

## Success Criteria
- All core functionality works as described
- UI is clean, responsive, and uses Aceternity UI components
- Errors/warnings are clearly highlighted
- Bonus features (if implemented) work as intended
