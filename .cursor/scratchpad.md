# Background and Motivation

The goal is to build a full-stack, type-safe Contract Verification-as-a-Service tool. The frontend will use Next.js (TypeScript) with Tailwind CSS and Aceternity UI for a modern, animated, dark-themed experience. The backend will be a Node.js/Express server that handles contract verification via Etherscan, BaseScan, and Arbiscan APIs, parsing contract bytecode and ABI, and returning results to the frontend. The app will be clean, modular, and ready for deployment (Vercel/Render).

# Key Challenges and Analysis
- Integrating Aceternity UI components with Next.js and Tailwind CSS for a cohesive, animated UI.
- Parsing contract bytecode to extract metadata (compiler version, optimization runs) using ethers.js.
- Handling multiple blockchain explorers (Etherscan, BaseScan, Arbiscan) with different APIs and error handling.
- Ensuring type safety and modularity across frontend and backend.
- Providing clear, actionable feedback to users (success, warnings, errors) with animated UI components.
- Managing environment variables securely for API keys.

# High-level Task Breakdown

## 1. Project Setup
- [ ] 1.1. Create Next.js app with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Aceternity UI integration.
  - Success: App runs, Tailwind and Aceternity UI components render.
- [ ] 1.2. Set up Node.js/Express backend with TypeScript.
  - Success: Backend server runs and responds to test endpoint.
- [ ] 1.3. Configure environment variables for API keys (Etherscan, BaseScan, Arbiscan).
  - Success: .env files in place, keys loaded in both frontend and backend.

## 2. UI Implementation
- [ ] 2.1. Build main form UI: Card container, two Textareas (bytecode, ABI), Select (network), animated Button.
  - Success: Form is centered, styled, and interactive.
- [ ] 2.2. Add Progress component for loading state.
  - Success: Progress bar/loader appears during verification.
- [ ] 2.3. Display results: Card Grid or Table, Badge for optimization, Alert for warnings/errors.
  - Success: Results and alerts render with correct data and animation.

## 3. Backend Implementation
- [ ] 3.1. Implement API endpoint to receive bytecode, ABI, and network; call relevant explorer API.
  - Success: Endpoint returns verification status, optimization details, errors.
- [ ] 3.2. Parse bytecode for metadata (compiler version, optimization runs) using ethers.js.
  - Success: Metadata extracted and compared with ABI.
- [ ] 3.3. Handle and return errors/warnings for metadata mismatches or API failures.
  - Success: Errors/warnings are returned in a structured format.

## 4. Frontend-Backend Integration
- [ ] 4.1. Connect frontend form to backend API, handle loading, success, warning, and error states.
  - Success: End-to-end flow works, all UI states are covered.

## 5. Polish and Deployment
- [ ] 5.1. Add comments, clean up code, ensure type safety throughout.
  - Success: Code is readable, maintainable, and type-safe.
- [ ] 5.2. Write README with setup, usage, and deployment instructions (Vercel/Render).
  - Success: Clear documentation for running and deploying the app.

# Current Status / Progress Tracking

- Planning phase: Initial breakdown complete. Awaiting user review/approval to proceed with implementation.

# Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- None yet. Will update as tasks are executed.

# Lessons
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding.
- Always ask before using the -force git command.
