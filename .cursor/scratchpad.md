## Project Status Board
- [x] Initialize a new git repository in DAY6 as requested
- [ ] Recreate auto_commit.py script for the new DAY6 git repository
- [ ] Review and confirm before running the script, as it will generate a large number of commits and push to the remote repository

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- A new git repository has been initialized in DAY6. The next step is to recreate the auto_commit.py script for this new repository. Please confirm if you want to proceed with the same script logic (3000 commits, push to remote) or if you want any changes before proceeding.
- The script auto_commit.py has been created in DAY6. It will:
  - Make 3000 commits, each with a unique message, by appending to a marker file in DAY6.
  - Add and commit the marker file for each commit.
  - Push all commits to the remote repository at the end.
- Please review and confirm before running, as this will create a large number of commits and push them to your remote repository. If you want to test with fewer commits first, let me know and I can adjust the script.
