   cd DAY5
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables (optional, for better data and higher rate limits):
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with any of the following:
   ```
   # Base, Ethereum, and Optimism RPC URLs (defaults provided)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ETH_MAINNET_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/your_infura_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_OPTIMISM_MAINNET_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.optimism.io

   # API keys for scan APIs (optional, for higher rate limits)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BASESCAN_API_KEY=your_basescan_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_OPTIMISM_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_opscan_key

   # Optional: Alchemy/Infura for enhanced reliability
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_API_KEY=your_infura_key
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Usage

1. Enter a wallet address or supported name (ENS, .op, .base.eth) on the homepage.
2. Select the chain (Base, Optimism, Ethereum) from the dropdown.
3. View your analytics: transaction count, gas spent, incoming/outgoing ETH & USDC, and more.
4. **To share your results:** Click the "Share as Image" button at the bottom of the analytics page. An image will be downloaded to your device.

## Limitations
- Some metrics may use default values if API rate limits are hit or data is unavailable.
- Name resolution depends on public RPC endpoints and may be affected by provider outages.
- The historical portfolio chart is currently disabled due to upstream API limitations.

## Future Enhancements
- Protocol/category breakdowns
- Leaderboards
- Multi-chain portfolio charts
- Social media sharing
